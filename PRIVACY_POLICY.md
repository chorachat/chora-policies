# Privacy Policy for Chora

**Last Updated:** [9.12.2025]

Welcome to **Chora** ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience on our app. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your information when you use our AI-powered chat application.

By using Chora, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect
We collect information to provide you with a personalized, memory-enhanced AI chat experience.

### A. Information You Provide
* **Account Information:** When you sign in via Google, we collect your email address, username, and authentication identifiers.
* **User Content:** We collect and store the text messages you send to the AI.
* **Subscription Data:** If you purchase a subscription, we collect purchase history and subscription status (e.g., Free vs. Pro tier). **Note:** We do not process or store your actual credit card details; this is handled securely by Google Play Billing.

### B. Information Generated by Your Use (The "Memory Graph")
Our application is unique because it remembers details about you to create a better conversation.
* **Derived Profile Data:** Our AI analyzes your conversation history to extract facts, preferences, habits, beliefs, and biographical details (e.g., "User likes Italian food," "User lives in Paris", "User had an interest to basketball in his childhood years").
* **Memory Graph:** This information is structured into a personalized "Memory Graph" stored in our secure graph database. This allows the AI to recall past conversations and maintain continuity. The generated data on the graph database is **only** accessed by the AI Character that the user chats with.

### C. Automatically Collected Information
* **Device Information:** We may collect device type, operating system, and crash logs to improve app stability.
* **Usage Data:** We track interaction metrics (e.g., number of messages sent, session length) to manage usage limits and improve performance.

## 2. How We Use Your Data
We use the collected data for the following purposes:
* **To Provide the Service:** Enabling real-time chat and generating AI responses.
* **To Personalize Your Experience:** Using the "Memory Graph" to ensure the AI remembers context, reducing the need for you to repeat yourself.
* **Account Management:** Authenticating your login and managing your subscription tier.
* **Service Improvement:** Analyzing usage trends to fix bugs and enhance AI performance.

---

## 3. Sharing Your Information
We do not sell your personal data. However, to provide our service, we must share data with specific third-party infrastructure providers:
* **AI Service Providers (e.g., OpenRouter, OpenAI):** Your chat messages are sent to third-party Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate responses. These providers process data to generate text but do not use your data to train their public models.
* **Payment Processors (RevenueCat, Google Play):** We share anonymous user IDs to validate subscription receipts and manage premium access.
* **Authentication Services (Google Firebase/Auth):** Used to verify your identity securely.

---

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion
* **Retention:** We retain your chat history and Memory Graph as long as your account is active to provide the "memory" feature.
* **Deletion:** You have the right to request the deletion of your data at any time.
    * **In-App Deletion:** You can delete your account from the app settings. This action triggers a "Hard Delete" workflow that permanently wipes your User Profile, Chat History, and Memory Graph from our databases (PostgreSQL and Neo4j).
    * **Manual Request:** You may also contact us at `chorachat.dev@gmail.com` to request deletion.

---

## 5. AI Disclaimer
* **Accuracy:** The AI responses are generated by machine learning models and may occasionally be inaccurate, offensive, or "hallucinate" facts. You should not rely on the AI for professional advice (medical, legal, financial, etc.).
* **Automated Profiling:** Our "Memory Graph" feature constitutes automated profiling. By using the app, you consent to this processing for the purpose of conversation continuity.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

Our Service is not intended for use by persons under the age of 18 (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware that a person under 18 has provided us with personal data, we will take steps to remove that information.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
